# GuardiansOfTheTunnels
This is a puzzle game where the users will be basically solving the minimum vertex cover problem. Users will be given a graph: a set of watch posts (vertices) and some tunnels (edges) connecting them. They will have to select some of the watch posts and put one soldier in each so that each of the tunnels is protected by at least one soldier. Here, a tunnel is said to be protected by a soldier if there is a soldier in at least one of its endpoints. Due to limited country resource, the number of soldiers has to be as small as possible.
